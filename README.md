# README

This project contains implementations of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using both Python and R. The project includes the following files:

1. `fashion_mnist.py` - Python implementation using Keras.
2. `fashion_mnist.r` - R implementation using Keras.

## Files

### fashion_mnist.py

This Python script uses the Keras library to build, train, and evaluate a CNN for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset. The script includes the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Build the CNN model with six layers.
3. Compile and train the model.
4. Evaluate the model on the test set.
5. Make predictions on sample images from the test set.

### fashion_mnist.r

This R script uses the Keras library to perform the same tasks as the Python script. The script includes the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Build the CNN model with six layers.
3. Compile and train the model.
4. Evaluate the model on the test set.
5. Make predictions on sample images from the test set.


# Output
Both scripts will output the following:

1. A summary of the CNN model architecture.
2. Training progress and validation accuracy during the training process.
3. Test accuracy after evaluating the model on the test set.
4. Predictions and visualizations for two sample images from the test set.
